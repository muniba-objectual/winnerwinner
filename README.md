## Debugging tool
The project has [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron) installed which is a useful debugging tool that allows you to inspect the app. It can be used to view API requests & responses. To use Reactotron, install the [Reactotron application](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/installing.md) locally, and run the app on a simulator in debug mode.
